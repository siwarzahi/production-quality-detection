# 📦 Production Quality Detection System

## 📝 Description
This project is an embedded system for real-time product quality supervision.  
It uses **Raspberry Pi 5 + Camera** with **YOLOv8 (TensorFlow)** to detect defects in production lines.  
When a defect is found, the system sends an **email alert** with details and the captured image.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi 5  
- Python 3, OpenCV, TensorFlow, YOLOv8  
- SMTP (for email alerts)  
- Linux Embedded (Raspberry Pi OS)
